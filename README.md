# Module_2_Lab_1
##I finished Lab 1 parts I-VIII.
I took a look at the template and connected to the server.
I edited the template and added tags.
I experimented with and added tags such as div, span, p, pre, ul, li, ol, article, table, thead, tbody, tr, td, th, img, video, audio, form, input, label, select, option, button.
I added a link from a Home to a Form page and vice versa.
I inspected the HTML I have written with the inspection tool and edited the styles with the developer console.
